# Project description

A foreign government comes to you and asks you to design their power grid.   From scratch. Can you do it?  Can you ensure the grid can safely supply electricity to everybody? And can you achieve the minimum environmental impact?

In this project, you will design a power system from scratch and perform several power flow simulations. The goal is to apply the fundamental methods and concepts from the lectures in a practical context. Along the way, you will face a number of design decisions and be guided by the central question:  

“How do renewables impact the power system if you were the grid operator?”

To explore this, you will begin by designing a conventional, robust transmission grid for a country or region of your choice. Then, you will gradually decarbonize the system by increasing the share of renewable energy sources. The project can be structured into the following steps:

1. Modelling of the grid (define region, demand, and synchronous generation)  
2. Implement baseline grid (incl. load scenarios and N-1 scenario)  
3. Renewable expansion scenarios  
4. Maximising renewable share  
5. Scenario comparison (economic, technical, CO₂-based)  

In this project, you will become familiar with the software tool PowerFactory.  You can find more details about PowerFactory on DTU Learn. Note that our DTU version supports a maximum of 50 buses. Consider this limit when you plan your system and leave some reserve for possible later adjustments.

The following describes the different stages your power grid will experience.   Starting from a “synchronous generators only” stage towards a grid with more and more renewable energy sources.   Do you think operating the grid becomes easier or harder?
