### Getting Started
This video demonstrates the fundamental steps required to build a simple power system model in PowerFactory. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Insert busbars  
- Configure a basic power grid comprising:  
  - One generator  
  - One transmission line  
  - One load  
  - Two transformers  

While PowerFactory provides an extensive library of standard network elements, it is often necessary to define custom ones to meet specific modeling requirements. This tutorial will also illustrate the procedure for creating such user-defined elements.
