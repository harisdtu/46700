# PowerFactory Tips
In this section you can find some tips on how to perform various tasks in PowerFactory.

### Creating a Project
In the following [video](https://panopto.dtu.dk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=740438b9-8150-43b5-873d-b35400f7beda) you can see how you can create a new project in Powerfactory, and how to view/activate/deactivate your existing projects.

### Getting Started
This [video](https://panopto.dtu.dk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c73f9ea2-b49e-4b2a-8014-b3540109c2ce) demonstrates the fundamental steps required to build a simple power system model in PowerFactory. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Insert busbars  
- Configure a basic power grid comprising:  
  - One generator  
  - One transmission line  
  - One load  
  - Two transformers  

While PowerFactory provides an extensive library of standard network elements, it is often necessary to define custom ones to meet specific modeling requirements. This tutorial will also illustrate the procedure for creating such user-defined elements.

### Running a Power Flow
This [video](https://panopto.dtu.dk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=73773567-9088-4980-bd0e-b3540115333d) demonstrates the essential steps for performing a basic power flow analysis in PowerFactory. Specifically, it covers how to:

- Assign appropriate voltage levels to the buses  
- Verify transformer connections  
- Adjust load and generator parameters  
- Display simulation results  
- Execute the power flow calculation
