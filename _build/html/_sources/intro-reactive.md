# Voltage Control Guidelines

While designing your system it is very likely that you will encounter voltage problems: either very low values during high-load conditions, or very high values in low-loaded lines. You have three main ways to handle voltage:

- **Reactive power compensation**
- **Tap changers**
- **Voltage setpoint adjustment**

## Reactive power compensation

You can use shunt elements or synchronous condensers, but the most flexible solution is a Static VAR System. This grid element can produce or consume reactive power and therefore increase or decrease voltage depending on your needs.
